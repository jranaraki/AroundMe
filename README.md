# AroundMe
The app is designed to keep the user aware of their environment by continuously scanning for close-by
devices. If a certain number of devices, chosen by the user, is detected in an already selected distance,
then the user will be prompted. This will help them to actively keep their distance from other people in
the same environment.

## Requirement
* Xcode 11.5
* Works on both iPhone and iPad
